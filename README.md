# MTB-HIV
## Overall description

This package includes three partitions, namely the DEA, DCA, and proximity sections. The DEA section is used to generate non-differential interactions (NDIs), while the DCA section is used to generate differential interactions (DIs). The proximity section is applied to drug repurposing based on the gene pair-based distance measures.

## Dependencies

	Perl ( >= 5.0 )
	R  (>= 4.0)
  	Python ( >= 3.8 )

## How to run the DEA and DCA scripts?

## Run DEA

Go to ./DEA/bin directory, you will see a run.pl script, and run the following command.

    perl run.pl -expr input_expression_file -sample input_sampleInformation_file -ppi input_ppi_file -disease input_disease_state -out /the/directory/of/output/
    -expr 		the path of expression matrix, such as ../examples/expression.txt
    -sample		the path of sampleInformation
    -ppi 			the path of protein-protein interations
	  -disease	the disease state(HMI/MMI/MHCI)
    -out			the path of results
    
    For example:
    perl run.pl -expr ../examples/input/GSE29429_expression.txt -sample ../examples/input/GSE29429_sampleInfor.txt -ppi ../examples/input/PPI.txt -disease HMI -out ../examples/output/

    if you want to detect the differential expressed genes, you can try the following command. (note that the R package Limma is needed)
    Rscript deg.R ../examples/expression.txt ../examples/sampleInfor.txt ../examples/outfile/

Results

You will obtain two output files in the directory /the/directory/of/output/, such as deg.txt, NDI.txt.  
The first file provides the logFC, P.Value, etc. in different conditions.  
The second file provides non-differential interactions.

## Run DCA
Go to ./DCA/bin directory, you will see a DCA.R script and run the following command.

	Rscript DCA.R input_expression_file input_sampleInformation_file input_ppi_file HMI /the/directory/of/output/
    input_expression_file     the path of expression matrix, such as ../examples/expression.txt
    input_sampleInformation_file     the path of sampleInformation
    input_ppi_file        the path of protein-protein interations

    For example:
    Rscript DCA.R ../examples/input/HMI ../examples/input/HC ../data/PPI.txt HMI ../examples/output/

You will obtain four output files in the directory /the/directory/of/output/, such as pairs.txt, GSE29429_disease_pcc.txt, GSE29429_HC_pcc.txt and DI.txt.   
The first file names every gene pair.  
The second and third files provide the PCC value in different conditions.  
The fourth file provides differential interactions.
